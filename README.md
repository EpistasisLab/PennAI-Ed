# PennAI-Ed
Materials for PennAI-Ed - an initiative to enhance AI and data science education built on PennAI

## OS Image

Eventually the image will be built using the pi-gen utility, but until that script is working we are manually distributing an .img file that can be flashed to a 32 GB SD card.

The image files can be found at: https://upenn.box.com/s/8g053zvmpgeagfw5h7eatboogtyslh7a

Good instructions detailing the process for installing OS images to an SD card are given at: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/
